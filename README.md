## Description

The user will be able to create a user account, log in and log out, save and delete articles, and view their saved articles.

## Instructions (to run locally) 

- Clone this repo
- Run the dev script `npm run dev`
- Use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/), [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/), or even the [Thunder Client](https://www.thunderclient.io/) ext. on VS Code (or any other of your favorites) to test the endpoints 

  <br/>

> [!NOTE]
> First, create a user and then check out the endpoints below

    <br />
   <p>Check below for a <a href="#endpoints-and-requests">table</a> that contains all endpoints and routes for this project.</p>

    <p>Here we are using the <code>/signup</code> route, and inside Postman (or your choice of API client), we add the name, email, and password in the request body for our test account.</p>
    <p>Then, we will sign into the newly created account (switch route to <code>/signin</code>) and ensure that we grab the Bearer Token.</p>
    After sending the authentication request, the API's response will appear in the response section of Postman. Look within the "Body" tab
   
<img width="330" height="354" alt="Your Bearer Token would be located here in the response body using Postman client tool" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4e6b2c4-dfc6-41f4-b73f-dbebf8825f24" />


<strong>Now</strong>, to use <em>any</em> of the endpoints, you will need to make the request with the Bearer token. 
Copy your token and paste it into the authorization or header section of your request.

<h2>Alternatively ...</h2>
Use your terminal:
<ul> 
<li><p>step 1: Sign up</p><code>curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Olivia", "email": "olivia@example.com", "password": "securepassword"}'</code></li>
  <li><p>step 2: Sign in</p><code>curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/signin \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "olivia@example.com", "password": "securepassword"}'</code> </li>
</ul>
