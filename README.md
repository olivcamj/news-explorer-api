   <p>Check below for a <a href="#endpoints-and-requests">table</a> that contains all endpoints and routes for this project.</p>

    <p>Here we are using the <code>/signup</code> route, and inside Postman (or your choice of API client), we add the name, email, and password in the request body for our test account.</p>
    <p>Then, we will sign into the newly created account (switch route to <code>/signin</code>) and ensure that we grab the Bearer Token.</p>
    After sending the authentication request, the API's response will appear in the response section of Postman. Look within the "Body" tab
   
<img width="330" height="354" alt="Your Bearer Token would be located here in the response body using Postman client tool" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4e6b2c4-dfc6-41f4-b73f-dbebf8825f24" />


<strong>Now</strong>, to use <em>any</em> of the endpoints, you will need to make the request with the Bearer token. 
Copy your token and paste it into the authorization or  header section of your request.
